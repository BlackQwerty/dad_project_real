 ### üìå Project Overview

The Lost & Found Management System is a full-stack distributed web application designed for reporting and managing lost and found items within university environments. Built using Spring Boot , MySQL , and Vanilla JavaScript + HTML , this system provides both public-facing and admin-facing interfaces with real-time analytics, secure login mechanisms, and image handling via ImgBB API integration.

Students and staff often lose or find personal belongings on campus, and this project addresses this common challenge by providing a structured digital platform for seamless reporting, intelligent matching, efficient claiming processes, and comprehensive monitoring of lost and found items. The system serves as a centralized hub that connects individuals who have lost items with those who have found them, significantly improving recovery rates while reducing administrative burden on university staff.


### üíº Commercial Value & Third-Party Integration

In real-world campus environments, this system significantly reduces administrative workload for staff members who traditionally handle lost and found operations manually, while simultaneously increasing the return rate of lost items through its efficient matching algorithms and user-friendly interface.

### üîó Integrated Third-Party Services

**ImgBB API**
- Purpose: Host uploaded item images
- Benefits: Reliable image storage and retrieval without burdening the main database

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- Purpose: Secure authentication and access control
- Benefits: Ensures system security and user role-based permissions

These third-party integrations enhance the system's scalability, security, and user experience while maintaining cost-effectiveness for educational institutions looking to implement modern lost and found management solutions.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Lost & Found Management System follows a client-server architecture with distributed components that work together to provide a seamless user experience.

### üì° API Documentation

#### ‚úÖ Main Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/report-lost` | POST | Submit lost item |
| `/api/report-found` | POST | Submit found item |
| `/api/reports` | GET | Retrieve all reports |
| `/api/match` | POST | Match lost & found items |
| `/api/claim/{id}` | PUT | Mark item as claimed |

## üîê Security

The Lost & Found Management System implements robust security measures to protect sensitive operations and ensure data integrity. All administrative endpoints including `/api/match`, `/api/claim/{id}`, and `/api/reports` are protected using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication.

### Authentication Flow
1. **User Login:** Administrators authenticate via `/api/auth/login` endpoint
2. **Token Generation:** System generates and returns a JWT upon successful authentication
3. **Token Usage:** Client includes the JWT in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema for all subsequent requests
4. **Token Validation:** Backend validates the JWT before processing sensitive operations

## üíª Frontend Applications

### üéØ 1. LostFound.html (Public User Interface)
- **Purpose:** Allows any university user to submit and view reports
- **Stack:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **API Integration:** Uses fetch() to call endpoints:
  - `/api/report-lost`
  - `/api/report-found`
  - `/api/reports` (GET with filters)

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Admin.html (Admin Panel)
- **Purpose:** Allows admin to view reports, manually match items, claim items, and view analytics
- **Stack:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js
- **API Integration:** Authenticated fetch with JWT to endpoints:
  - `/api/reports`
  - `/api/claim/{id}`
  - `/api/match`
  - `/api/stats/*`

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

The Lost & Found Management System uses a relational database design to store user information, item reports, and related data. Below is an overview of the database schema, including entity-relationship diagrams and table structures.

### üìä Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ REPORT : has
    REPORT {
        Long id PK
        String name
        String category
        String description
        String location
        Date dateReported
        String type
        String status
        String imageUrl
        Long matchedWith FK (nullable)
    }
    USER {
        Long id PK
        String email
        String password
        String role
    }

The system consists of two main entities: `USER` and `ITEM`. The relationship between these entities is defined as follows:

- **USER**:
  - Each user can report multiple items.
  - Users have roles such as "admin" or "public" to manage access permissions.

- **ITEM**:
  - Each item is reported by a specific user (`reported_by` foreign key).
  - Items include details like name, category, description, location, date reported, image URL, type (lost/found), and status.

### üìù Schema Justification

#### **USER Table**
- **id**: Primary Key (PK) - Unique identifier for each user.
- **username**: Unique Key (UK) - Ensures usernames are unique for login purposes.
- **password**: Stores hashed passwords for secure authentication.
- **role**: Defines user roles (e.g., admin, public) to control access levels.
- **email**: Optional field for user contact information.

#### **ITEM Table**
- **id**: Primary Key (PK) - Unique identifier for each item report.
- **name**: Name of the lost or found item.
- **category**: Category of the item (e.g., accessories, electronics).
- **description**: Detailed description of the item.
- **location**: Location where the item was found or lost.
- **date_reported**: Timestamp indicating when the item was reported.
- **image_url**: URL of the uploaded image hosted on ImgBB API.
- **type**: Indicates whether the item is "lost" or "found".
- **status**: Current status of the item (e.g., pending, matched, claimed).
- **reported_by**: Foreign Key (FK) linking to the `USER` table, indicating which user reported the item.

### üìú Table Structures

#### **USER Table**
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | int       | PK          |
| username    | string    | UK          |
| password    | string    |             |
| role        | string    |             |
| email       | string    |             |

#### **ITEM Table**
| Column Name   | Data Type | Constraints |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| id            | bigint    | PK          |
| name          | string    |             |
| category      | string    |             |
| description   | string    |             |
| location      | string    |             |
| date_reported | string    |             |
| image_url     | string    |             |
| type          | string    |             |
| status        | string    |             |
| reported_by   | int       | FK          |

### üîó Relationships
- **One-to-Many Relationship:** A single user (`USER`) can report multiple items (`ITEM`).
- **Foreign Key:** The `reported_by` column in the `ITEM` table references the `id` column in the `USER` table.

This database design ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying for both user management and item reporting functionalities.
